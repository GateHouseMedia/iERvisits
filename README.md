# Analyzing ER visits for youth sports injuries

We used two decades worth of consumer product-related ER data to show that sports injuries for patients under 18 peak in September, largely due to football injuries. 

The main data was downloaded year by year from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) maintained by the [U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data) and collated by [Kenny Jacoby] (https://twitter.com/kennyjacoby). 

I also downloaded survey data from the [National Federation of State High School Associations] (https://www.nfhs.org/ParticipationStatics/ParticipationStatics.aspx/) to figure out the most popular high school sports in each state.
