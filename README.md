# Analyzing ER visits for youth sports injuries

We analyzed two decades worth of consumer product-related emergency room data in R to show that sports injuries for patients under 18 [peak in September](http://gatehousenews.com/kids-are-back-on-the-field-injuries-are-on-the-rise/), largely due to football injuries. 

The main data was downloaded year-by-year from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, maintained by the [U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data), and collated by [Kenny Jacoby](https://twitter.com/kennyjacoby). Feel free to contact us at the email address below if you would like a copy of the combined dataset.

I also downloaded survey data from the [National Federation of State High School Associations] (https://www.nfhs.org/ParticipationStatics/ParticipationStatics.aspx/) to figure out the most popular high school sports in each state.
